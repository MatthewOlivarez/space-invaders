# space-invaders
Very basic Space Invaders-type game. Player controlled movement with arrow keys, and enemy ship has random movement. Once the enemy or player has been hit, the game ends.
Drawing panel is needed for the program to compile and run. That can be found here: https://www.buildingjavaprograms.com/code-files/4ed/javadoc/DrawingPanel.html
